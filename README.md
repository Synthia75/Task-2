# Introduction
This project is a Python program designed to simulate and analyze workflows in a multi-task system. It provides insights into task dependencies, predicts task completion times, and offers recommendations for resource reallocation to optimize performance under varying workloads.

# Features
Data Import and Validation:
Import workflow data from a CSV file.
Validate task dependencies to ensure no circular dependencies.
Workflow Analysis:
Predict completion times for dependent tasks.
Identify delays and inefficiencies in workflows.
Calculate the total time required to complete workflows.
Optimization Recommendations:
Analyze resource allocation and suggest improvements.
Highlight critical paths in workflows.
Visualization:
Gantt charts for workflow timelines.
Network diagrams for task dependencies.
Bar charts comparing predicted and actual task completion times.
# How to Use
Prepare workflow data in a CSV format with clearly defined tasks and dependencies.
Run the program to generate analysis and visualizations.
Review the outputs to understand inefficiencies and implement optimization recommendations.
# Outputs
Visualizations: Clear, graphical representations of workflows and task dependencies.
# Goals
The aim of this project is to:
Enhance understanding of workflow performance.
Identify bottlenecks and delays.
Suggest actionable recommendations for better resource management.
